                        therewith. The parties are not partners, joint ventures or otherwise affiliated, and
                        neither has any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any
                        kind to bind the other party without prior written consent.

                        irreparable and continuing injury to NVIDIA for which monetary damages may not be an
                        adequate remedy and therefore NVIDIA is entitled to seek injunctive relief as well as
                        such other and further relief as may be appropriate. If any court of competent
                        jurisdiction determines that any provision of the AGREEMENT is illegal, invalid or
                        unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Unless
                        otherwise specified, remedies are cumulative.
